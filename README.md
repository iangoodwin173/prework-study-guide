# Prework Study Guide

## Description

- My motivation to build this project was to get initial hands-on experience in coding with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git/GitHub
- I made this guide to use as a reference throughout both the bootcamp process and my professional career
- This guide gives everyone who uses it a central place to refer to the basics of each coding language
